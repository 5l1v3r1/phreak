# Phreak
Oldschool phone phreaking. 
Back in the early 90's when no kid owned a cellphone, 
I wrote an ANSI C program that output DTMF tones via terrible 8 bit audio.     
Made an even worse recording of it on a mono tape.    
Played it back into a payphone handset via my sony walkman's orange headphones.     

Voila, free calls! ...
